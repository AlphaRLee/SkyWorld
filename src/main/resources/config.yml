# Decorations are custom structures that can be loaded into the game world
#   name: The name of the decoration (CURRENTLY UNUSED)
#   type: Nature of where the decoration can spawn. Valid choices are "air", "floor", "ceiling", and "wall"
#   schematic: The name of the schematic file being used (file must be .schem type).
#     Schematics should be stored inside ./plugins/WorldEdit/schematics/
#   spawnChance: The probability between 0 and 1 that the decoration will be spawned. Lower numbers are more rare
#   spawnAttempts: The number of times the decoration will attempt to find a valid region to spawn in
#     Note: This occurs before the spawnChance is calculated.
#       If spawnAttempts is set to 10 and spawnChance is set to 0.01,
#       then the system will try 10 random locations to spawn this decoration.
#       If any of the locations are valid, then there is a 0.01 (1%) chance a decoration will spawn at that location
